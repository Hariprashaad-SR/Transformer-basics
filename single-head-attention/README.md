# SELF ATTENTION MECHANISM

An attention mechanism is an Encoder-Decoder kind of neural network architecture that allows the model to focus on specific sections of the input while executing a task. It dynamically assigns weights to different elements in the input, indicating their relative importance or relevance. By incorporating attention, the model can selectively attend to and process the most relevant information, capturing dependencies and relationships within the data. This mechanism is particularly valuable in tasks involving sequential or structured data, such as natural language processing or computer vision, as it enables the model to effectively handle long-range dependencies and improve performance by selectively attending to important features or contexts.
